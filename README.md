### Motivation

There are only 2 books about haxe in the market and both are already outdated. In addition there are not much more online resources about learning the newest Haxe version (version 3), which is not really something attractive for the newest interested people in the language.


### "Haxe 2 Beginner's guide" examples and code, translated to HaXe 3

This is a HaXe 3 port of the examples from the book "Haxe 2, Beginner's Guide".
It is part of my learning and training of haxe language.

### Disclaimer

I have no relation with the authors or copyright owners of the book.

Since I am an <strike>absolute n00b</strike> Haxe beginner, I don't expect to make everything error free.
Your feedback is welcome.
