### Haxe 2 Beginner's guide example's in HaXe 3

This is a HaXe 3 port of the examples from the book "Haxe 2, Beginner's Guide".
It is part of my learning of haxe, and I have no relation with the authors or copyright owners of the book.

There are only 2 books in the market about haxe and both are already outdated, and there are not much more online resources about learning new Haxe, which is not really something attractive for interested in the language.

Since I am an <strike>absolute n00b</strike> Haxe beginner, I don't expect to make everything error free.
Your feedback is welcome.
